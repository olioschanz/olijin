### Hi there 👋

I'm Oli - a data-driven program manager who enjoys turning real-world challenges into practical, user-friendly tools. Using Python and data science to bridge technical development with strategic problem-solving.

I recently bult [Literature Scout](https://github.com/olioschanz/literature-scout.git), an app that lets you set a custom time range, and instantly finds and organizes scientific papers on targeted products.

⛁ Most projects start with small problems I’ve run into and grow into tools others can use — from automating repetitive tasks to improving data accuracy and making sense of messy information.

🌱 My background in biotech has shown me how the right application can streamline workflows, improve decision-making, and uncover insights hidden in complex data. I’m especially interested in projects with a clear, practical impact, no matter how big or small.
